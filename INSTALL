Installation Instructions
*************************

This GoTools package uses CMake to generate a Makefile (on Linux) or
MS Visual Studio project file (on Windows).

For information on using CMake, see www.cmake.org.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LINUX

As a Quick Start Guide, on Linux, make a build directory inside the source
directory
$ cd <path_to_source_code>
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

Run the cmake program to setup the build process, selecting Debug or Release
as build type, optionally selecting a local install folder:
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release (-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/install)

For a gui-like cmake interface use ccmake (from cmake-ncurses-gui).

Build the library:
$ make

Install the library to a local folder (requires the use of
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX with a local folder in the previous step):
$ make install

If the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX in the cmake step was omitted or was set to a
system folder (like /usr/local) the user needs elevated privileges to install
the library:
$ sudo make install

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WINDOWS

On Windows, add a new build folder somewhere. Start the CMake
executable and fill in the paths to the source and build folders. When
you run CMake, a Visual Studio project solution file will be generated
in the build folder.
